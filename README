Presentation
============

The infinit cryptography library provides a set of functions and abstractions
for performing high-level cryptographic operations on buffers and streams.

Dependencies
============

The library relies upon several other libraries:

  o OpenSSL which provides the fundamental cryptographic operations.
  o Elle which provides basic types and the serialization mechanism enabling
    one to perform cryptograhic operations on any serializable type.
  o Comet which extends OpenSSL so as to provide deterministic pseudo-random
    generation.

Environment variables
=====================

These variables can be used to parameter the library:

  o INFINIT_CRYPTOGRAPHY_RANDOM_SOURCE defines the path to the source file
    from which data will be read in order to initialize the random generator.
    The default value for this variable is: "/dev/random"
  o INFINIT_CRYPTOGRAPHY_ROTATION activates the key rotation mechanism enabling
    one to derive key pairs, public and private keys from a seed in a
    deterministic way.
  o INFINIT_CRYPTOGRAPHY_LEGACY activates the legacy mode which includes older
    encryption functionalities and an ancient serialization mechanism.

Internals
=========

One should be extremely careful when it comes to modifying the cryptographic
classes, in particular the elements being serialized. Indeed, should these
attributes change, the format of the given class should be incremented so as
to make sure older serialized versions of the class can still be deserialized
and used.

In addition, it will be appreciated if one could update the tests so as to
register the new formats and make sure the older ones are still consistent.
